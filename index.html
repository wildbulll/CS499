            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>I am a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University, set to graduate in Fall 2025. 
                My coursework introduced me to full-stack development, database management, and cloud 
                migration, which have become my primary areas of interest. I've also gained valuable experience working 
                with AI and I'm eager to continue building on this knowledge. This portfolio showcases my academic projects, 
                with a featured code review that guides you through my process of making improvements to my work. Please feel 
                free to explore my work and connect with me to discuss new opportunities.

            <h2>Code Review</h2>
            <p>
                This is my code review video for CS 499. It covers the project structure, logic, 
                and improvements I will make to my Grasioso Salvare Dashboard. This dashboard was 
                a project I created in CS 340 Client Server Development in January of 2025. By 
                enhancing this project, I will highlight the skills I've developed at Southern 
                New Hampshire University, connecting what I learned in my coursework on software 
                design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases to a real-world application.
