      <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact is an interactive dashboard web application created using Dash and Python. 
        It was initially developed in March of 2025 as part of the CS-340 course to display and analyze animal 
        rescue data through tables, charts, and maps. The original version had basic layout and filtering options.

        Justification for Inclusion in ePortfolio:
        This dashboard shows that I can build a complete data visualization tool from start to finish 
        while managing both the design and functionality of a full-stack application. I created an interactive 
        layout that includes a data table, pie chart, and map, with each component connected to live data and 
        organized using a responsive Flexbox structure so they adjust when the screen is resized. The dashboard 
        pulls live data and updates the charts and map automatically, which shows I can connect data to visual 
        displays. I also customized the colors, layout, and spacing to make the app easy to use and visually 
        appealing. There are still a few options that need improvement, I plan to address those in the next 
        milestone when I work on the database.

        Outcomes Achieved in This Milestone:
        <ol>Better Layout with Flexbox:
        <li>Before, the dashboard stacked everything vertically with no clear order. I used Flexbox to split the main area into two side-by-side columns, making it easier to see and use on different screen sizes.
        <li>Improved Visual Design:
        I added a round logo with a red border next to a bold title and used consistent colors, spacing, and shadows to make the dashboard look cleaner and more professional.
        <li>Organized and Clear Code:
        I grouped related parts like filters and tables together and added comments. This makes the code easier to understand and update.
        <li>More User-Friendly Data Table:
        I added scrolling so the table does not get too big, and kept features like sorting and filtering to help users explore data easily. 
        <li>Consistent Styling:
        I made sure dropdowns, buttons, and headings all have matching spacing and sizes, and fixed the sizes of charts and maps to keep everything neat and balanced.
        <li>Smarter Data Options:
        Instead of showing every column in the pie chart dropdown, I picked a shorter list of options to help users easily find and sort the data they need. This makes the app easier to use and the code easier to manage.
        <li>Outcomes and Updates:</li>
          <p>
            Yes, the changes I made in this milestone helped me meet the course goals I set earlier. I worked on 
            creating easy-to-use designs and writing clean, organized code. This project helped me better understand 
            how to make websites that work well on different screens and how to improve user experience. My 
            outcome-coverage plan mostly stays the same because I feel like I completed the milestone requirements 
            that improve the design and code.  I do realize I need to have a deeper understanding of accessibility 
            and performance to make my apps better for all users if I want to excel in this field. So, I plan to add 
            these areas to my learning goals and future projects.
          </p>
        <li>Reflection on the Enhancement Process:</li>
            <p>
              I improved this project by making layouts that adjust to different screen sizes, which helps users have a better experience. I also realized it is important to balance how things work with how they look, so the app is intuitive and easy for users to understand without struggling, while still looking good. Some challenges I had were figuring out the best way to arrange parts of the page, so everything is clear and fits well on different screens. I also spent time adjusting spacing and sizes to make the design look professional but not too busy. I also needed to debug some options to make sure everything worked correctly, and I have included a picture below to show the results. Testing and changing these details bit by bit helped me solve these problems. This work taught me how important it is to design software carefully, focus on the user’s needs, and write code that is easy to understand and update for future use.

      <h2>Artifact Enhancement</h2>
      <p>
        I enhanced an interactive animal rescue dashboard built with Dash and Python by redesigning the layout 
        using Flexbox to create a responsive interface that works well on all screen sizes. 
        I improved the visual design with consistent colors, clear spacing, and professional styling, while 
        organizing the code for better readability and easier maintenance.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The data table was made more user-friendly with scrolling, sorting, and filtering features, 
        and I simplified pie chart options to focus on meaningful data. These changes boosted usability 
        and demonstrated my skills in full-stack development, responsive design, and creating intuitive 
        data visualizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this process, I deepened my understanding of balancing form and function, debugging, 
        and writing clean, maintainable code — skills I plan to build on in future projects.

        <h2>Bonus:</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Debugging the code: I was getting unwanted search options for my pie chart dropdown menu  
            <li>Debug: print(df.columns) showed all columns
            <li>Debug: print(df.head())</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
         <p>Changing this:
         
        To this:
         
        Only include these options:
