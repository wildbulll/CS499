      <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact is an interactive dashboard web application created using Dash and Python. 
        It was initially developed in March of 2025 as part of the CS-340 course to display and analyze animal 
        rescue data through tables, charts, and maps. The original version had basic layout and filtering options.

      <h2>Justification for Inclusion in ePortfolio</h2>
      <p>
        This dashboard shows that I can build a complete data visualization tool from start to finish 
        while managing both the design and functionality of a full-stack application. I created an interactive 
        layout that includes a data table, pie chart, and map, with each component connected to live data and 
        organized using a responsive Flexbox structure so they adjust when the screen is resized. The dashboard 
        pulls live data and updates the charts and map automatically, which shows I can connect data to visual 
        displays. I also customized the colors, layout, and spacing to make the app easy to use and visually 
        appealing. There are still a few options that need improvement, I plan to address those in the next 
        milestone when I work on the database.

      <h2>Outcomes Achieved in This Milestone</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Better Layout with Flexbox:</li>
          <p>
            Before, the dashboard stacked everything vertically with no clear order. I used Flexbox to split
            the main area into two side-by-side columns, making it easier to see and use on different screen sizes.
          </p>
          <li>Improved Visual Design:</li>
          <p>
            I added a round logo with a red border next to a bold title and used consistent colors and spacing 
            to make the dashboard look cleaner and more professional.
          </p>
          <li>Organized and Clear Code:</li>
          <p>
            I grouped related parts like filters and tables together and added comments. This makes the code easier to 
            understand and update.
          </p>
          <li>More User-Friendly Data Table:</li>
          <p>
            I added scrolling so the table does not get too big, and kept features like sorting and filtering to help
            users explore data easily. 
          </p>
          <li>Consistent Styling:</li>
          <p>
            I made sure dropdowns, buttons, and headings all have matching spacing and sizes, and fixed the sizes 
            of charts and maps to keep everything neat and balanced.
          </p>
          <li>Smarter Data Options:</li>
          <p>
            Instead of showing every column in the pie chart dropdown, I picked a shorter list of options to help users 
            easily find and sort the data they need. This makes the app easier to use and the code easier to manage.
          </p>
        </ol>

        <h2>Reflection on the Enhancement Process:</h2>
            <p>
              I improved this project by making layouts that adjust to different screen sizes, which helps
              users have a better experience. I also realized it is important to balance how things work with
              how they look, so the app is intuitive and easy for users to understand without struggling, while
              still looking good. Some challenges I had were figuring out the best way to arrange parts of the page,
              so everything is clear and fits well on different screens. I also spent time adjusting spacing and sizes
              to make the design look professional but not too busy. I also needed to debug some options to make sure
              everything worked correctly, and I have included a picture below to show the results. Testing and changing
              these details bit by bit helped me solve these problems. This work taught me how important it is to design
              software carefully, focus on the userâ€™s needs, and write code that is easy to understand and update for 
              future use.

        <h2>Bonus:</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Debugging the code: I was getting unwanted search options for my pie chart dropdown menu  
            <li>Debug: print(df.columns) showed all columns
            <li>Debug: print(df.head())</li>
          </ul>

          Changing this:<br>        
          To this:<br>         
          Only include these options:<br>
          In the pie chart:
