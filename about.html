        <h2>I. Self-Introduction</h2>

        <h3>A. How long have you been in the Computer Science program?</h3>
        <p>
          My original goal was to get an associate’s degree in information technology. 
          I began working on this in October of 2019. 
          I am so thankful that my employer funded the cost of my tuition and after completing my associate’s 
          degree I did not want to stop learning. 
          I had the opportunity to pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science, 
          but I did not feel like I was smart enough. My husband convinced me that even if 
          I got bad grades I was still working on something I that loved and wanted to do for a long time. 
          Now I am just weeks away from achieving my goal of getting a degree and pursuing my dream of 
          becoming a full-stack developer.
        </p>

        <h3>B. What have you learned while in the program?</h3>
        <p>
          I was very shy in high school and was a very terrible student and barely graduated with a C average because 
          I did not know how to ask for help. I was shocked at the math and physics concepts that I have learned at SNHU. 
          It was taught in a way that was easy for me to understand. What helped me the most was the amount of knowledge 
          and talent each of my instructors possessed. This provided me with an outlet that I felt confident to reach out 
          to whenever I struggled or was stuck on parts of assignments that I did not understand. 
        </p>
        <p>Three important concepts I’ve learned:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Matrix Math:</strong> Helped me understand algorithms and logic for handling data transformations.</li>
          <li><strong>Discussion Posts:</strong> Improved my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly.</li>
          <li><strong>Debugging Code:</strong> Taught me patience, problem-solving, and logical thinking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. Skills to demonstrate through enhancements</h3>
        <p>
          I want to show I can build full apps with clean code, smart design, and solid database access. I’ll demonstrate:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Secure login features</li>
          <li>Organized data handling with sorting/filtering</li>
          <li>Full CRUD operations with efficient queries</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>D. Career Alignment</h3>
        <p>
          I want to be a full stack developer, so I’m focusing on writing clean code, working with databases, 
          and securing user data. Later, I plan to explore AWS to scale apps for more users.
        </p>

        <h3>E. Specialization Target</h3>
        <p>
          This project will help me build the core skills I need for a full stack development role. 
          It gives me practice working with both the front end and the back end. The class I took prior to this, 
          CS470 Full Stack 2, prepared me to launch a full stack application to the cloud with AWS. I want to become well  
          versed in full-stack development and then gain knowledge of app migration to the cloud. 
        </p>

        <h2>IV. ePortfolio Skill Set</h2>

        <h3>A. Code Review</h3>
        <p>
          I’ll demonstrate clean, commented code that uses:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Correct data structures</li>
          <li>Efficient algorithms</li>
          <li>Modular design</li>
          <li>Secure database integration</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Narratives</h3>
        <p>
          I’ll describe the story behind each project: what I built, challenges I faced, how I improved the code, and what I learned.
        </p>

        <h3>C. Self-Assessment</h3>
        <p>
          I’ll reflect on how I’ve grown, where I still want to improve, and how my skills in communication and coding have prepared me 
          for a career in full stack development.
        </p>
