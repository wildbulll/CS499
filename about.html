    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Get to know me!</p>
    <p>I.	Self-Introduction: Address all of the following questions to introduce yourself.

A.	How long have you been in the Computer Science program?

My original goal was to get an associate’s degree in information technology. I began working on this in October of 2019. I am so thankful that my employer funded the cost of my tuition and after completing my associate’s degree I did not want to stop learning. I had the opportunity to pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science, but I did not feel like I was smart enough. My husband convinced me that even if I got bad grades I was still working on something I that loved and wanted to do for a long time. Now I am just weeks away from achieving my goal of getting a degree and pursuing my dream of becoming a full-stack developer.

B.	What have you learned while in the program? List three of the most important concepts or skills you have learned.

I was very shy in high school and was a very terrible student and barely graduated with a C average because I did not know how to ask for help. I was shocked at the math and physics concepts that I have learned at SNHU. It was taught in a way that was easy for me to understand. What helped me the most was the amount of knowledge and talent each of my instructors possessed. This provided me with an outlet that I felt confident to reach out to whenever I struggled or was stuck on parts of assignments that I did not understand. 

The three top concepts to me are 

1. Matrix Math: Matrix math seemed hard at first, but it helped me learn important ideas behind complex algorithms. It also helped me understand the logic needed to handle data and transformation, which are important for software design, building algorithms, and managing databases.

2. Discussion Posts: Writing discussion posts helped me get better at explaining technical parts of my assignments. Being able to say what I am doing and why it is important not just for showing that I understand the material, but also to show that I can communicate well with others. 

3. Debugging Code: Debugging used to be very frustrating, but it has helped me improve my problem-solving skills. It has taught me how to think through the steps of my project to find where the problems are and use logic which is important for making software that works well and does not break.

C.	Discuss the specific skills you aim to demonstrate through your enhancements to reach each of the course outcomes.

I want to show that I can build a working apps with all the parts needed, including clean commented code, good design, and database access. For algorithms, I want to show that I know how to organize and process data, like sorting and filtering information to make apps faster and easier to use. For databases, I want to show that I know how to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data with well-structured queries. My project will store, get, and manage data to keep everything organized and working the way it should. 

How do the specific skills you will demonstrate align with your career plans related to your degree?

The skills I want to highlight include building secure login features, organizing data with databases, and writing clean, well-structured code. This will support my goal of becoming a full stack developer. I want to create apps that are both useful and fun, and these skills are a strong starting point. Later, I plan to learn how to use tools like AWS to host and grow my apps so they can handle more users.

D.	How does this contribute to the specialization you are targeting for your career?

This project will help me build the core skills I need for a full stack development role. It gives me practice working with both the front end and the back end. The class I took prior to this, CS470 Full Stack 2, prepared me to launch a full stack application to the cloud with AWS. I want to become well  versed in full-stack development and then gain knowledge of app migration to the cloud. 
IV.	ePortfolio Overall Skill Set

A.	Accurately describe the skill set to be illustrated by the ePortfolio overall.
i.	Skills and outcomes planned to be illustrated in the code review.

In my code review, I will show that I know how to write clean code that is commented and easy-to-read. I will point out how I use computer science skills like choosing the right data structures, writing efficient algorithms, connecting to and working with databases, and building apps in a modular and scalable way. I will also show how I can fix bugs, improve my code over time, and make it run better and more securely.

ii.	Skills and outcomes planned to be illustrated in the narratives.

In the narratives, I will explain the story behind each project, why I built it, what challenges I faced, and how I solved them. I will walk through how I planned my enhancements, what I changed, and why those changes matter. This will show how I have grown as a developer and how it connects what I learned in my courses to real-world problems and solutions.

iii.	Skills and outcomes planned to be illustrated in the professional self-assessment.

In my self-assessment, I will reflect on how far I have come in the program. I will talk about what I do well, what I want to keep improving, and how my projects show that I am ready to work in the tech world. I will also explain how I have used technical, communication, and problem-solving skills together to prepare for a career in software or full-stack development.
