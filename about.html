      <section>
        <p>I’m Stacey Griggs, a soon-to-be graduate with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from SNHU. 
          I started this journey in 2019 with the goal of earning an associate degree in IT—but I didn’t stop there. 
          With support from my employer and family, I built the confidence to pursue my dream of becoming a 
          full-stack developer.
        </p>

        <h2>Growth Through the Program</h2>
        <p>Before SNHU, I struggled academically due to a lack of confidence and support. This program changed everything. 
          I learned to seek help, tackle complex problems, and develop technical fluency. From matrix math to debugging 
          logic errors, I grew in areas I never imagined possible.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Skills and Strengths</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clean, well-documented code</strong> using modular design and secure practices</li>
          <li><strong>Strong debugging skills</strong> and the ability to communicate technical challenges</li>
          <li><strong>Comfort with full-stack development:</strong> backend logic, databases, APIs, and front-end UI</li>
          <li><strong>Version control and collaboration:</strong> GitHub, Git, and Agile methodology</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>
          My career aspiration is to become a full-stack developer, with a strong focus on building secure, applications. 
          My goal is to strengthen my development skills, security best practices, and cloud deployment strategies to
          deliver reliable and scalable solutions.
