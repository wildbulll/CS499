    <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
    <p><strong>Stacey Griggs</strong><br />
    CS 499: Computer Science Capstone<br />
    August 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> <a href="https://wildbulll.github.io/CS499/" target="_blank">https://wildbulll.github.io/CS499/</a></p>

    <p>Over the course of my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have developed practical skills and a deeper understanding of software design, algorithms, database systems, and secure programming practices. The final project in CS 499 gave me the opportunity to revisit and enhance past coursework, showing both how much I’ve grown and how I apply that knowledge in a real-world context.</p>

    <p>This self-assessment reflects on how my work in this course and the program as a whole demonstrates my ability to meet the four SNHU Computer Science program outcomes, which are:</p>

    <h2>1. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve problems and meet the requirements of varied users</h2>
    <p>Throughout the program, I’ve worked on projects that involved creating software to meet real user needs. For example, my <strong>Animal Rescue Dashboard</strong> (available on my portfolio) is a web application that allows users to browse and filter animals using an interactive interface. I enhanced this project during CS 499 to include user-friendly features like the ability to favorite animals and revisit those choices. These updates demonstrate my ability to build meaningful and user-centered computing solutions.<br />

    <h2>2. Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions</h2>
    <p>In CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms, I implemented and analyzed sorting algorithms, binary search trees, and hash tables. These core concepts influenced how I approached later projects, especially when optimizing performance and organizing data. I revisited this work in my portfolio to reflect on how theoretical knowledge supported the enhancements I made in CS 499.<br />

    <h2>3. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts</h2>
    <p>My ability to explain technical decisions has improved through the program. For this final project, I wrote clear, structured enhancement narratives, documented code with in-line comments, and presented my work on GitHub Pages for easy access. These communication skills are reflected in my portfolio and are essential for collaborating in professional environments.<br />

    <h2>4. Recognize professional, ethical, legal, and security issues in computing and respond with appropriate strategies</h2>
    <p>In CS 305: Software Security, I learned secure coding practices like access control, input validation, and dependency checks. I applied these concepts by reviewing my projects for vulnerabilities and improving how data was handled—especially when enhancing user interaction features. These considerations show my commitment to building secure and ethical systems.<br />

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Completing the BS in Computer Science program has given me a strong foundation in software development, problem-solving, and secure coding practices. My GitHub Pages portfolio at <a href="https://wildbulll.github.io/CS499/" target="_blank">https://wildbulll.github.io/CS499/</a> highlights this journey with enhanced projects, narratives, and skills that I will take with me into the workforce. I am confident in my ability to continue growing as a software developer and contributing to real-world technology solutions.</p>
