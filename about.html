      <section>
        <p>I’m Stacey Griggs, a soon-to-be graduate with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from SNHU. 
          I started this journey in 2019 with the goal of earning an associate degree in IT—but I didn’t stop there. 
          With support from my employer and family, I built the confidence to pursue my dream of becoming a 
          full-stack developer.
        </p>

        <h2>Growth Through the Program</h2>
        <p>Before SNHU, I struggled academically due to a lack of confidence and support. This program changed everything. 
          I learned to seek help, tackle complex problems, and develop technical fluency. From matrix math to debugging 
          logic errors, I grew in areas I never imagined possible.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Skills and Strengths</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clean, well-documented code</strong> using modular design and secure practices</li>
          <li><strong>Strong debugging skills</strong> and the ability to communicate technical challenges</li>
          <li><strong>Comfort with full-stack development:</strong> backend logic, databases, APIs, and front-end UI</li>
          <li><strong>Version control and collaboration:</strong> GitHub, Git, and Agile methodology</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>
          My career aspiration is to become a full-stack developer, with a strong focus on building secure, applications. 
          My goal is to strengthen my development skills, security best practices, and cloud deployment strategies to
          deliver reliable and scalable solutions.

        <h2>CS 499 Artifact and Enhancements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/wildbulll/CS340" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Original Grazioso Salvare Dashboard:</a></strong> A 
              full-stack web app that allows users to filter animal data and save favorites, built as part of CS 340.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="sde.enhancement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Design / Engineering Enhancement:</a></strong> I refactored 
              parts of the Grazioso Salvare dashboard code to improve structure and readability, applying object-oriented 
              design principles. I also streamlined data handling by reducing redundancy and making the filtering logic 
              easier to extend.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="ads.enhancement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement:</a></strong>I reworked 
              the filtering system to use more efficient algorithms and data structures, including trees and optimized 
              sorting. This improved both performance and scalability when handling larger datasets.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="db.enhancement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Databases Enhancement:</a></strong>I updated the database 
              queries to prevent SQL injection and enforced parameterized statements. I also ensured sensitive data was 
              handled with secure coding practices, reducing vulnerabilities in the application’s database interactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Sets Me Apart</h2>
        <p>
          I bring real-life experience, determination, and a love for learning to my work. 
          At 50, I’m starting a new career in tech and I’m excited to grow my skills. 
            Even though I’m new, I put my full effort into every project and always look for ways to get better. 
            I work well with others, communicate clearly, and believe in building trust.
